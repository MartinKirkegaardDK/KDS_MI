For a while she was at last underfoot, her feet d jævn over the ground. He was about to call for her, but it was too indefiné. Her legs had slid out, and she had turned under the bill, her feet","ved Aftenstid kom Duen tilbage til ham, og se, den havde et friskt Olieblad i Næbbet. Da skønnede Noa, at Vandet var svundet bort fra Jorden.","The dove came back to him at evening, and, behold, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off. So Noah knew that the waters were abated from the earth.",22,15,193
" og dette var det første, som duen så; og den bragte duen tilbage til arken, og den sad i arken indtil den ","  But the bird was gone; the dove was gone.  And the son of the king said to the man:  ""Come, son, go and seek the son of the king.  You will find him at the place where the son of the king was  shown to the king.  Find him.""  And the man went.  And the king said to the man:","ved Aftenstid kom Duen tilbage til ham, og se, den havde et friskt Olieblad i Næbbet. Da skønnede Noa, at Vandet var svundet bort fra Jorden.","The dove came back to him at evening, and, behold, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off. So Noah knew that the waters were abated from the earth.",23,15,193
