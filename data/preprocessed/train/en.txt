This guidance can include guidelines, protocols and checklists [expert consensus].
It was a very lonely few weeks with only my host for company, but eventually I was allowed to come home.
Surveillance data show that antimicrobial resistance is a growing public health problem in European hospitals and communities.
Checklist for prescribers in hospitals and other healthcare settings
For patients with a severe infection, initiate effective antibiotic treatment as soon as possible [31,74].
In the continuous fight for "ecological space", all resistant bacteria are selected as the antibiotic kills the still-susceptible bacteria around them.
Conversely, many healthcare-associated infections are caused by microorganisms that are not resistant to antimicrobials.
Clinical tasks related to improving antibiotic use include [102] [expert consensus]:
h) Considering local microbiology and antibiotic resistance patterns when prescribing empirical antibiotic treatments;
Antifungals (active against fungal infections),
I also missed family weddings and baptisms.
In addition, more than 43 countries in the European region have had campaigns since that year, all under the EAAD umbrella.
Ensure that laboratory results are promptly communicated to the treating physician [expert consensus].
Clinicians are responsible for prescribing and they must be fully engaged in shared decision-making with the antibiotic stewardship team [42].
In this patient's case, her bacterium was only sensitive to colistin, an antibiotic which has to be given intravenously and can be toxic.
Antibiotic resistance - an increasing threat to human health - Design files - EN - [ZIP-3.71 MB]
There are many reasons for different rates of resistance that can include antibiotic use, underlying diseases, quality of hospital care, immunisation rates and social factors.

The proportion of broad-spectrum antibiotics varied from 16% to 62% across Europe.
d) Never share leftover antibiotics with other people.
i) liaising with public health organisations,
Misusing antibiotics increases the risk of infections with multidrug-resistant bacteria [15].
1 in 20 residents received at least one antimicrobials on any given day.
This refers to the agreement reached by ECDC experts, EAAD Technical Advisory Committee members, and other external experts and stakeholders.
It is the microorganisms that colonise and sometimes infect humans and animals which become resistant to antimicrobials, not the humans or animals themselves.
Thankfully, I am now fully recovered and free of the infection, but for a time I was very afraid of catching a cold or something worse.
c) Documenting the indication for antibiotic treatment, drug choice, dose, route of administration and duration of treatment, in the patient chart, when you prescribe an antibiotic;
After arrival in Ponza, he felt that he had symptoms of a urinary tract infection, but did not pay too much attention at the time, because he thought his symptoms could have been due to dehydration from the summer heat.
Resistant E. coli may then spread between people.
The primary target audience for this toolkit is professionals in hospitals and other healthcare settings, such as long-term care facilities, who have different roles and influence in the use of antibiotics in such settings.
Train hospital prescribers regularly on prudent antibiotic use and participate in meetings on implementing evidence-based hospital antibiotic guidelines [31,53,94,95].
The latest data confirms that across the European Union the number of patients infected by resistant bacteria is increasing and that antibiotic resistance is a major threat to public health.
Promote vaccination programmes for residents and staff [expert consensus].
Spread and cross-transmission of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms between humans, between animals, and between humans and animals and the environment.
Only start antibiotic treatment if there is evidence of a bacterial infection, and do not treat colonisation [31].
They are also responsible for infections and isolated from food-producing animals and sometimes isolated from foods.
a) Prescribing according to evidence-based hospital antibiotic guidelines for common infections and for surgical prophylaxis;
Whenever antibiotic-resistant bacteria emerge and develop, infection control precautions are essential to prevent spread from carriers of infected patients to other patients or persons.
If you are organising a communication campaign to raise awareness on prudent use of antibiotics, you can use our toolkits and campaign materials .
The checklist was conceived as a small card that can be kept in white coat pockets and consulted as a reminder of prudent antibiotic prescribing.
On 18 November from 09.30 to 15.00 we will be tweeting live from our European Antibiotics Awareness Day 2019 Launch Event.

Toolkit for engaging in social media activities promoting prudent antibiotic use
Nosocomial infections and antimicrobial resistance are two special health issues listed in Annex 1 of Commission Decision 2000/96/EC of 22 December 1999 on the communicable diseases to be progressively covered by the Community network under Decision No 2119/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council.
g) Ensuring that prudent antibiotic use and prevention of antibiotic resistance are "priority action areas" in your hospital's annual plan.
Key messages for primary care prescribers
Antibiotic resistance is more likely to develop and spread when [39] [expert consensus]:
Does the patient have an infection that will respond to antibiotics?
1 in 15 hospital patients have at least one HAI;
Antimicrobial stewardship targeting primary care prescribers as well as infection prevention and control interventions in primary care are therefore necessary to reduce the burden of these infections.
While people die in developing countries because they lack access to the correct antimicrobial treatment, antimicrobial resistance resulting from inappropriate use is causing concern in every continent;
How serious is the problem?
Aside from the carbapenems, which are given intravenously and require some type of hospital stay, there were only few antibiotics that he could take that would be effective against his infection, and few that he could take by mouth.
A patient leaflet for primary care prescribers to hand out to patients: it explains to patients what antibiotic resistance is and why appropriate use of antibiotics is important.
Following adoption of the European Union (EU) Council Recommendation on the prudent use of antimicrobial agents in human medicine in November 2001, which stated that EU Member States should inform the general public of the importance of prudent use of antimicrobial agents and the success of some national campaigns, such as Belgium and France, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) decided in 2008 to establish the European Antibiotic Awareness Day (EAAD) on 18 November as a platform for providing support to national campaigns across the region.
Why are some countries more affected than others?
The laboratory results showed that the only antibiotics that Paolo's E. coli was sensitive to were amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fosfomycin and finally, a class of last line antibiotics called the carbapenems.
The key messages need to be carefully adapted as well, since professionals across Europe might have different roles than those described in the document.
Up to half of all antibiotic use in hospitals is unnecessary of inappropriate.
j) Managing your hospital's antimicrobial formulary (i.e., list of drugs available for prescribers).

b) Have the appropriate cultures been taken before starting antibiotic therapy?
• 86% reported reduced use of broad-spectrum antibiotics;
f) Using evidence-based antibiotic guidelines and policies;
A model for a patient dialogue on the basis of available evidence provides guidance and support for primary care prescribers who encounter patient pressure for antibiotics, and promotes appropriate antibiotic use by patients.
a) Administering antibiotics to patients according to the prescription;
d) Educating hospital prescribers on how to diagnose and treat common infections, and on the antibiotic stewardship principles;
h) vaccination of healthcare workers alongside occupational health,
This may delay getting the right treatment to patients and may result in complications, including death.
The two major drivers for antimicrobial resistance are:
g) Managing antibiotic stocks on your ward, and ensuring the traceability of antibiotic use [expert consensus].
Which antibiotics are used in food-producing animals?
To reduce this risk, hospitals put in place preventive actions: hand-washing or disinfection with alcohol-based solution, antisepsis before performing surgery, screening and isolation of patients at high risk of carrying resistant bacteria, and prudent use of antibiotics.
Support the development and implementation of an antibiotic stewardship programme within your organisation [69].
Additionally, he was allergic to one of them, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
c) Implementing targeted educational activities and training that:
What is ECDC doing to keep antibiotics working?
Pharmacists can have multiple roles in the emergency department, including giving real-time feedback and consultation regarding prescribing practices, and identifying drug interactions.
Template letters to pharmacists and primary care prescribers
h) Never share leftover antibiotics with other people.
MRSA is mainly acquired through direct contact from human to human or via equipment or medical devices.
Before the discovery of antibiotics, thousands of people died from bacterial diseases, such as pneumonia or infection following surgery.
b) Coordinating the taking and sending of microbiological specimens, and their reporting back to physicians;
- Patients have a 24% increased risk of mortality with any antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection [13].
What are the risks of resistant E. coli in hospitals?
Travellers that require hospital care while visiting a country with high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, within or outside of the EU, and who are subsequently repatriated to their home country, may return being colonised or even infected by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
For patients with sepsis, initiate effective antibiotic treatment via the intravenous route as soon as possible [90].
b) Ensuring infection prevention and control guidelines, protocols and checklists are available for preventing both healthcare-associated infections and transmission of microorganisms
Following infection prevention and control measures reduces the incidence of healthcare-associated infections.
Promote peer-review of antibiotic prescriptions and infection management, and encourage communication among healthcare professionals [71].
Explain to patients how to relieve symptoms of colds and flu without antibiotics.
Correct timing and optimal duration of antibiotic prophylaxis for surgery leads to fewer surgical site infections, and decreases the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria [73].
Avoid unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis [31].
When possible, prescribe an antibiotic that is specific to the infection and not "broad spectrum".
Persuasive measures include proactive audit and feedback by infectious diseases physicians, microbiologists and pharmacists.
There has been a rise in the rates of such highly resistant bacteria throughout the world.
ECDC also partners with numerous professional and patient organisations, the European Commission, the European Food Safety Authority, the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe, as well international campaigns in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Japan, to undertake a number of actions to address antimicrobial resistance.
The mandate of ECDC is to identify and assess the risks of communicable diseases for EU citizens and communicate about these risks; this includes the area of antimicrobial resistance.
Countries with lower resistance rates have generally lower use of antibiotics, whereas countries with higher antibiotic resistance rates use more antibiotics.
This is why his condition apparently improved during amoxicillin-clavulanic acid treatment, but the infection was not eradicated and suddenly relapsed after the therapeutic course.
Antibiotics are often prescribed to patients in hospitals without explaining the importance of prudent antibiotic use [expert consensus].
It is therefore necessary to see a doctor and to have microbiological testing performed.
Antimicrobials are sometimes given to patients to prevent infections, for example to prevent infections in relation with surgical procedures.
ECDC also launched, and regularly updates, a directory of online resources for the prevention and control of antimicrobial resistance and healthcare-associated infections to support EU Member States that need to develop national guidelines.
For further detailed information and ideas how to use these materials and organise a campaign on self-medication with antibiotics, please see the Guidance note.
This could be minimised through adequate infection prevention and control measures, as well as antibiotic stewardship in healthcare settings.
Without #antibiotics, we won't be able to treat simple infections.

d) Communicating all relevant patient background and treatment decisions to in- or out-patient follow-up practitioners.
More than half of certain HAIs are considered preventable.
How is our use of antibiotics contributing to the problem
In 2016-2017, ECDC coordinated the second point-prevalence survey of healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial use in European acute care hospitals and the third point-prevalence survey of healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial use in European long-term care facilities.
Each year across Europe, EAAD is marked by national campaigns on the prudent use of antibiotics on or around 18 November.
g) Educating all relevant healthcare professionals on infection prevention and control interventions to reduce the transmission of both antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-susceptible bacteria.
Antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, including multidrug-resistant types, are often responsible for healthcare-associated infections, but they are also responsible for infections in patients outside hospitals and can be found as part of the normal bacterial flora of healthy individuals, in pet animals and in the environment.
Lill-Karin, Norway, caught bacteria resistant to many antibiotics after an accident and a hospitay stay while on holiday abroad.
b) More adverse events, because alternative antibiotic therapies, that are more toxic, must often be used;
Restrictive measures include pre-approval and post-authorization decisions for specific antibiotics;

Follow infection prevention and control measures that are already established in your setting.
Previous antibiotic treatment, e.g. with fluoroquinolones, has been associated with higher risks of resistance in E. coli.
c) The dose of antibiotic is either too low or too high;
Key messages: Antimicrobial use in healthcare settings
Remain aware of local antibiotic resistance patterns in your department, your hospital and in the community [31] [expert consensus].
Antibiotics, also known as antimicrobial drugs, are medicines that can kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria to cure infections in people, animals and sometimes plants.
Successful public awareness campaigns, which have already taken place in some countries, have resulted in a reduction of antibiotic consumption.
Follow your doctor's advice when taking antibiotics.
h) Monitoring antibiotic resistance and use, and making this information available to prescribers.
A pharmacist-led parenteral-to-oral switch resulted in shortened parenteral therapy durations without negatively impacting on clinical outcomes [56].
This time I'm hoping to see the country, not just the hospital.
Examples of antibiotic stewardship strategies, actions and outcomes in European countries include:
At population level:

Paolo was on the island of Ponza where there was no possibility of laboratory testing of his urine to better understand which antibiotics the bug could be treated with.
General key messages for healthcare professionals in hospitals and other healthcare settings
Follow antibiotic treatment protocols, based on evidence-based guidelines (e.g. for sepsis [74], urinary tract infections [103], skin and soft tissue infections [104]), and apply infection prevention and control measures that are established in your setting [31] [expert consensus].
ECDC would be interested to know how and where the campaign communication materials are used, particularly if you think that your initiatives could be listed on the ‘National activities' page of this website.
Once controlled for size of population, the Member States that use the most antibiotics for outpatients, i.e. Greece and Cyprus, use approximately three times more per inhabitant and per year than the Member State that uses the least, i.e. the Netherlands;
Use them wisely - and never against colds and flu
From my time in hospital I learnt the importance of strict hygiene and using disinfectant handwash and home cleaners to keep bugs at bay.
Improving antibiotic use in the emergency department can lead to better antibiotic use across the entire organisation, because the emergency department is a common point of entry to the inpatient setting [77].

Cephalosporins, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones and anti-anaerobe antibiotics have a high risk of selecting for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria [40].
Antibiotic regimens started in your department strongly influence what therapy is continued in the hospital and community settings [77].
Overview of the data on antimicrobial resistance in Europe released in 2014
Between 2007 and 2015, the burden of each of the 16 antibiotic-resistant bacteria under study has increased:
Media type
He then called a friend of his, an infectious disease specialist, who suggested that he take fosfomycin by mouth in the correct dose for his infection.
To address this public health concern, the Council of the European Union issued a recommendation in 2001 asking countries to put in place actions to ensure prudent use of antibiotics (Council recommendation of 15 November 2001 on the prudent use of antimicrobial agents in human medicine (2002/77/EC).
Antibiotics are misused when they are prescribed unnecessarily (i.e. antibiotic treatment is not clinically needed) or when they are prescribed inappropriately, i.e. one of the following [18]:
Organise and promote educational events, courses and meetings together with hospital administrators to strengthen infection prevention and control activities among all healthcare professionals (e.g. hand hygiene, contact precautions, active screening cultures, and environmental cleaning) [89].
Document the indication of antibiotic treatment, drug choice, dose, route of administration and duration of treatment in the patient chart [31,42,70,71].

Escherichia coli resistance to major antibiotics is increasing in almost all countries in Europe.
Antimicrobial use in: Long-term care facilities
Multidrug resistance corresponds to resistance of a microorganism to multiple antimicrobials.
Antibacterials (often called antibiotics, active against bacterial infections),
Because resistance is increasing and few new antibiotics have been discovered and marketed in recent years, antibiotic resistance is now a major public health threat.
Regularly participate in training courses and in meetings that support the implementation in the hospital of: a) prudent antibiotic use, b) evidence-based, local antibiotic guidelines, and c) infection prevention and control measures [52,53].
Key messages for hospital managers / administrators
When exposed to antibiotics, susceptible bacteria are killed and resistant bacteria can continue to grow and multiply.
Other tasks include [31,42,56,82,85-87]:
g) Never use leftover antibiotics from previous treatments; and
40% of all Europeans wrongly believe that antibiotics work against colds and flu, show the data from the 2013 Eurobarometer on antibiotic consumption and knowledge.
• 58% reported reductions in antibiotic resistance.
It is concerning that such highly resistant bacteria are spreading in the community and causing infections in patients with no contact with the hospital.
The two major areas for management, control and prevention of antimicrobial resistance therefore are:
The EARSS Annual Report 2007 indicated that seven Member States now report significantly decreasing percentages of MRSA among Staphylococcus aureus from bloodstream infections.
54% reported some dedicated staff time for antimicrobial stewardship.
This antibiotic can appear sensitive in the laboratory, but is actually not effective against ESBL E. coli when given for treatment in humans.
d) Consulting with hospital prescribers and providing them with feedback to ensure the quality of antibiotic prescribing;

What are the causes of resistant E. coli?
Implement guidance (guidelines, protocols and checklists) for infection prevention and control measures, together with the infection prevention and control team [86,87] [expert consensus].
Levels of antibiotic consumption consistently correlate with levels of antibiotic resistance, i.e. the more antibiotics are being used in a population, the more resistance to antibiotics there will be in bacteria responsible for infections in this population.
- Patients are up to three times more likely to die if their infections is caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, compared with carbapenem-susceptible isolates [14].
Your tasks related to improving antibiotic use include [31,42,56,71,75]:
Additionally, within the body of a human being, the genes coding for antibiotic resistance in one species of bacteria can easily spread to other bacterial species through an exchange of genetic material.
Management of these risks as well as of the factors that contribute to control of communicable diseases are under the responsibility of each EU Member State.
Activities related to this topic at ECDC, take place under the Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare-associated Infections programme .

Answer the following key questions when reassessing antibiotic therapy after 48-72 hours (or as soon as microbiological results are available) [42,70]:
f) Ensuring antibiotic stewardship programmes are integrated with policies and
Antibiotic stewardship programmes can successfully reduce Clostridium difficile infection rates [19,22,43,44,48].
7 out of 10 antimicrobials were administered parenterally.
iv. enhance prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections and the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
Treating infections due to resistant bacteria is a challenge: antibiotics commonly used are no longer effective and doctors have to choose other antibiotics.
This is the only exception where systemic antibiotics can be dispensed without a prescription.
Since antibiotics have been discovered and used, more and more bacteria, which were originally susceptible, have become resistant and developed numerous different means of fighting against antibiotics.

b) Appointing leaders that are responsible for the overall programme and for antibiotic use.
d) The duration of antibiotic therapy is either too short or too long;
Coordinate hospital surveillance of healthcare-associated infection through using both [82,85] [expert consensus]:
Treatment of antibiotic-resistant bacteria may also require intravenous antibiotics given in hospitals instead of oral antibiotics that could be taken by patients at home.
When you use antibiotics incorrectly: if you shorten the duration of treatment, lower the doses, don't comply with the right frequency (taking the drug once a day instead of 2 or 3 times a day as directed), you won't have enough drug in your body and the bacteria will survive and may become resistant.
Cover a number of professionals working at hospitals and other healthcare settings: managers/administrators, infectious disease specialists, infection prevention and control professionals, epidemiologists, prescribers, junior doctors and students, pharmacists, nurses, clinical microbiologists, and professionals in emergency departments, in intensive care units, and in long-term care facilities.
Prolonged surgical prophylaxis represents a significant source of unnecessary use of antimicrobials in hospitals, which needs to be addressed across Europe.
Before you prescribe an antibiotic, you should [25,26,53,70] [expert consensus]:

Burden of infections with resistant bacteria
Antibiotics should not be used when they are not needed, e.g. for viral infections such as common colds or influenza;
Certain structural strategies can improve antibiotic prescribing and patient outcomes.
For how long should the patient receive the antibiotic(s)?
Documenting indication, drug choice, dose, route of administration and duration of treatment in the patient chart leads to better use of antibiotics.
Eventually, I was moved to a private room and had a hip replacement operation.
f) Never save antibiotics for later use;
Most prophylaxis courses may therefore represent unnecessary use of antimicrobials.
After arriving at the hospital, I spent two days on a plastic bed in a large room, surrounded by sick people.
It is important for physicians to be on the lookout for cases of patients carrying bacteria with such antibiotic resistance.
Take a thorough patient history when you prescribe an antibiotic, including recent antibiotic use, drug allergies, use of immunosuppressive therapy, and risk factors for antibiotic resistance (for example, recent hospitalisation, recent procedure or recent travel outside of Europe) [31].
While this practice may reduce the risk of infection in women, there is no evidence about its effectiveness when applied widely to elderly patients.
Some of the messages are indicated to be "expert consensus", instead of being linked to a reference taken from the scientific literature.
d) Facilitating communication between physicians, the pharmacy, the laboratory, discharge planners, consultants and patients;
Permission to use the European Antibiotic Awareness Day campaign communication materials is granted to all non-profit organizations and healthcare associations as well as all European healthcare authorities and governmental bodies conducting campaigns aimed at reducing antibiotic resistance and promoting the appropriate use of antibiotics.

Antibiotic resistance and food-producing animals
The European Antibiotic Awareness Day is an annual European public health initiative that takes place on 18 November to raise awareness about the threat to public health of antibiotic resistance and the importance of prudent antibiotic use.
In a pooled analysis of antibiotic stewardship programmes, total consumption fell (by 19% hospital-wide and by 40% in intensive care units), overall antibiotic costs were reduced (by about one third), and the hospital length of stay shortened (by 9%).
Ensure that patients (and their families) understand the reason for antibiotic therapy, and key points related to antibiotic use, including to [31,69] [expert consensus]:

Italy - A four-year infection control programme decreased the incidence of infections and colonisation caused by carbapenem-resistant bacteria in a teaching hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a danger to us all because they cause infections that are difficult to treat.
If these guidelines do not exist in your hospital, then support their development [31,54,56].
Document the indication of antibiotic treatment, drug choice, dose, route of administration and duration of treatment in the patient chart[31,42,70,71].
Because resistance is increasing and few new antibiotics have been discovered and marketed in recent years, the problem of antibiotic resistance is now a major public health threat.

You are in an important position to improve antibiotic prescribing in both inpatients and outpatients, since your facility sits at the interface of the hospital and the community [77].
Depending on the country, all or none of the LTCFs have antimicrobial use guidelines.
Antimicrobial management initiatives that promote prudent antibiotic use are called antibiotic stewardship programmes [19,42-45].
The sum of these DALYs across the population, or the burden of disease, can be thought of as a measurement of the gap between current health status and an ideal health situation where the entire population lives to an advanced age, free of disease and disability.
Provide funds and resources for an antibiotic stewardship programme (including e.g., salaries for dedicated staff, IT capabilities, rapid and point-of-care diagnostic tests) [31].
It can then cause local skin infections or more life-threatening infections such as pneumonia, bloodstream infections and surgical site infections.
- Patients with bloodstream infections have a threefold higher mortality rate, prolonged hospital stays, and higher costs if their infection is due to third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli, compared with third-generation cephalosporin-susceptible isolates [12].

A total of 8.9 million HAIs were estimated to occur each year in European hospitals and long-term care facilities combined.
d) Reduced quality of patient stay due to anxiety because of the need for rigorous infection control measures;
The bacterium was susceptible only to one antibiotic, colistin.
The EARSS Annual Report 2007, as well as national data, indicated decreasing resistance trends in Streptococcus pneumoniae, a bacteria commonly responsible for infections in outpatients, in particular children;
HAIs in hospitals alone cause more deaths in Europe than any other infectious disease under surveillance at ECDC.
Antibiotic resistance is a natural occurrence caused by mutations in bacteria's genes.
e) Take antibiotics exactly as prescribed;
A more worrying problem is when some bacteria that are normally susceptible to antibiotics become resistant as a result of adaptation through genetic change (acquired resistance).
Self-medication with antibiotics is not a responsible use of antibiotics
d) Monitoring compliance with infection prevention and control guidelines;
Antibiotic consumption varies widely between EU/EEA countries.
Answer the following key questions when reassessing antibiotic therapy after 48-72 hours (or as soon as microbiological results are available) [42,70]:
Resistant bacteria survive in the presence of the antibiotic and continue to multiply causing longer illness or even death.
This issue of multidrug resistance is relevant for all microorganisms, including bacteria responsible for healthcare-associated infections, microorganisms responsible for food- and waterborne infections, tuberculosis, and microorganisms responsible for sexually-transmitted diseases, e.g. gonorrhoea and HIV.
The most important thing to protect yourself and your family from MRSA is to comply with simple hygiene measures: clean and cover wounds, cuts and scrapes, keep your hands clean until they are healed, and avoid sharing personal items such as razors and towels.
• Long-term surveillance of the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (e.g. in intensive care units, or for specific infection types).
Examples of such bacteria are carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacteriaceae (often Klebsiella pneumoniae), andmultidrug-resistant Acinetobacter.

These resistant bacteria may spread and cause infections in other people who have not taken any antibiotics.
75% of the burden of bacteria resistant to antibiotics in Europe is due to healthcare-associated infections.
Key messages for professionals in hospitals and other healthcare settings
Reviewing initial antibiotic treatment after 48-72 hours and switching from parenteral to oral administration (when possible), reduces antibiotic resistance rates and improves clinical outcomes [37,54,57,71,92,93].
Materials for professionals in hospitals and other healthcare settings
Are they related to antibiotics used in humans?
Each year, 33000 people die from an infection due to bacteria resistant to antibiotics.
Any use of an antimicrobial forces microorganisms to either adapt or die.
When it is resistant to methicillin (or to oxacillin, a type of penicillin), it is called MRSA or "Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus".

When they are no longer effective, it is extremely difficult or, in many cases, impossible to treat these infections.
However, the major cause of antimicrobial resistance in microorganisms from humans remains the use of antimicrobials in human medicine, in the community and in hospitals and other healthcare settings.
It is important to treat with the right antibiotic, since these types of highly resistant bacteria can cause patients to be sicker and to have a worse outcome.
