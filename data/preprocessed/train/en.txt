In a pooled analysis of antibiotic stewardship programmes, total consumption fell (by 19% hospital-wide and by 40% in intensive care units), overall antibiotic costs were reduced (by about one third), and the hospital length of stay shortened (by 9%).
a) Following local evidence-based antibiotic guidelines for common infections;
Professionals in emergency departments should only start antibiotic treatment if there is evidence of a bacterial infection, avoid unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis, ensure that cultures are taken before starting antibiotics
For patients with sepsis, initiate effective antibiotic treatment via the intravenous route as soon as possible [90].
Bacteria have antibiotic resistance when specific antibiotics have lost their ability to kill or stop their growth.
Since 2008, numerous health-related and professional organisations, as well as the European Commission and the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe (WHO/Europe), have partnered with ECDC in preparing communications materials and planning activities targeting audiences such as the general public and professionals in hospitals.
E. coli is generally harmless but may sometimes cause infections, mainly urinary tract infections.
f) Using evidence-based antibiotic guidelines and policies;
Organise and promote educational events, courses and meetings together with hospital administrators to strengthen infection prevention and control activities among all healthcare professionals (e.g. hand hygiene, contact precautions, active screening cultures, and environmental cleaning) [89].
Regularly organise audits/surveys of antibiotic prescribing practices and of healthcare-associated infections [93].
Even without having been in contact with healthcare, people who travel in a country with high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance may return being colonised by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
Is the patient on the correct antibiotic(s), correct dose, and correct route of administration?
Consulting the antibiotic stewardship team increases the quality of drug prescribing and improves patient outcome [56,83].
d) Communicating all relevant patient background and treatment decisions to in- or out-patient follow-up practitioners.
For bacteria, antibiotic resistance is the ability of bacteria to resist to the action of an antibiotic.
Activities related to this topic at ECDC take place under the Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare-associated Infections programme .

Paolo could not take trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which is an oral antibacterial agent, because he was allergic to it.
Antimicrobial resistance is the ability of a microorganism (e.g., a bacterium, a virus, or a parasite, such as the malaria parasite) to resist the action of an antimicrobial agent.
Your tasks related to improving antibiotic use include [31,42,56,71,75]:
Antibiotic regimens started in your department strongly influence what therapy is continued in the hospital and community settings [77].
Antibiotics used to treat and prevent bacterial infections in animals belong to the same chemical groups as those used for humans: macrolides, tetracyclines, quinolones, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides.
It is not always possible to determine the proportion of resistant infections caused by a single factor.
Infectious disease specialist interventions have been associated with a significant improvement in the quality of antibiotic prescribing and leading a reduction in antibiotic use [83].

Responsible use of antibiotics can help stop resistant bacteria from developing and help keep antibiotics effective for the use of future generations.
Infections caused by resistant bacteria may require more care as well as alternative and more expensive antibiotics, which may have more severe side effects.
Check that antibiotic prescriptions follow antibiotic treatment protocols, based on evidence-based guidelines.
Successful public awareness campaigns, which have already taken place in some countries, have resulted in a reduction of antibiotic consumption.
In 2016-2017, ECDC coordinated the second point-prevalence survey of healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial use in European acute care hospitals and the third point-prevalence survey of healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial use in European long-term care facilities.
• Too low doses of antibiotics are used.
Promoting prudent antibiotic use is both a patient safety and a public health priority [31,42].
All antibiotic-resistant bacteria survive in the presence of the antibiotic and continue to grow and multiply causing longer illness or even death.
Examples of antibiotic stewardship strategies, actions and outcomes in European countries include:
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a global strategy and guidelines to help countries in setting up systems to monitor antimicrobial resistance and implement interventions, e.g. to ensure that antibiotics can only be purchased with a medical prescription.
If you are organising a communication campaign to raise awareness on prudent use of antibiotics, you can use our toolkits and campaign materials .
Antibiotic consumption varies widely between EU/EEA countries.
Cephalosporins, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones and anti-anaerobe antibiotics have a high risk of selecting for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria [40].
Therefore, animals may acquire bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics also used against human infections.
The EARSS Annual Report 2007 indicated that seven Member States now report significantly decreasing percentages of MRSA among Staphylococcus aureus from bloodstream infections.

Spain - After only one year, education on guidelines combined with regular feedback led to a 26% improvement in the rate of appropriate treatments, and a 42% reduction of antibiotic consumption at a tertiary teaching hospital [67].
It is the microorganisms that colonise and sometimes infect humans and animals which become resistant to antimicrobials, not the humans or animals themselves.
d) Educating hospital prescribers on how to diagnose and treat common infections, and on the antibiotic stewardship principles;
The main risk factors for resistant E. coli in the community are previous antibiotic treatment.
d) Timely identification and reporting of microorganisms (e.g. in blood cultures) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing;
Follow antibiotic treatment protocols, based on evidence-based guidelines (e.g. for sepsis [74], urinary tract infections [103], skin and soft tissue infections [104]), and apply infection prevention and control measures that are established in your setting [31] [expert consensus].
Such bacteria may eventually become resistant to all existing antibiotics.
Your tasks related to improving antibiotic use include [31,96,97] [expert consensus]:
Train hospital prescribers regularly on antibiotic resistance, and on use of rapid and point-of-care diagnostic tests [31,53].
To address this public health concern, the Council of the European Union issued a recommendation in 2001 asking countries to put in place actions to ensure prudent use of antibiotics (Council recommendation of 15 November 2001 on the prudent use of antimicrobial agents in human medicine (2002/77/EC).
a) Making available evidence-based hospital antibiotic guidelines and clinical pathways for diagnosing, treating and managing the most common infections encountered in your department (i.e. respiratory tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, urinary tract infections and sepsis).
Key messages for clinical microbiologists
Levels of antibiotic consumption consistently correlate with levels of antibiotic resistance, i.e. the more antibiotics are being used in a population, the more resistance to antibiotics there will be in bacteria responsible for infections in this population.
More than half of certain HAIs are considered preventable.
Organise educational events and campaigns that provide residents with information on prudent antibiotic use.
d) Educating staff on infectious diseases and prudent use of antibiotics.
d) Never share leftover antibiotics with other people.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) contributes to keep antibiotics working by ensuring that Europe has a good overview of the situation on antibiotic resistance and antibiotic consumption with a yearly update of its European surveillance data, and actively promotes and advocates prudent use of antibiotics.
These improvements did not cause any increase in adverse patient outcomes [46].

Key messages for hospital infection prevention and control professionals and hospital epidemiologists
Answer the following key questions when reassessing antibiotic therapy after 48-72 hours (or as soon as microbiological results are available) [42,70]:
The situation is getting worse with the emergence of new bacterial strains resistant to several antibiotics at the same time (known as multidrug-resistant bacteria).
Even when antibiotics are used appropriately, antibiotic resistance sometimes develops as a natural adaptive reaction of bacteria.
While this practice may reduce the risk of infection in women, there is no evidence about its effectiveness when applied widely to elderly patients.
Molecular analysis showed that the isolate contained a gene responsible for producing the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1), a novel carbapenemase.
Losing effective options for the treatment and prevention of infections is a global health security threat [31].
It took two months and three courses of different antibiotics before Paolo's infection was successfully treated.
A factsheet on antibiotic resistance in primary care provides primary care prescribers with EU and national data on the latest trends.
These resistant bacteria may persist, generally without causing infection, up to six months and sometimes longer;
Healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial resistance European acute care hospitals and long-term care facilities
The two major areas for management, control and prevention of antimicrobial resistance therefore are:
Avoid unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis [31,73].
This is an increase from 2007 and is worrying because these antibiotics are the last treatment option available.
Although some HAIs can be treated easily, others may more seriously affect a patient's health, increasing their stay in the hospital and hospital costs.
Any other entities must obtain the consent of the ECDC before using the European Antibiotic Awareness Day campaign communication materials.
Pharmacists can have multiple roles in the emergency department, including giving real-time feedback and consultation regarding prescribing practices, and identifying drug interactions.
Germany - Implementing a computerised decision support system led to higher adherence to locally adapted guidelines, increased antibiotic-free days and reduced mortality over a five-year period in five intensive care units [60].
In India, your family is expected to look after you in hospital, so I didn't see much of the doctors or nurses.
Prompt prescribers to document their reviewing decision for all patients on antibiotics after 48-72 hours [31,42,69].
1/6 of Europeans are not aware that the misuse of antibiotics makes them less effective (with subtitles)
The two major drivers for antimicrobial resistance are:
In such cases, you won't improve your condition by taking antibiotics: antibiotics don't lower fever or symptoms like sneezing.
The checklist was conceived as a small card that can be kept in white coat pockets and consulted as a reminder of prudent antibiotic prescribing.
This antibiotic can appear sensitive in the laboratory, but is actually not effective against ESBL E. coli when given for treatment in humans.
Make guidance for infection prevention and control measures to reduce healthcare-associated infections and transmission of microorganisms readily and reliably accessible.
d) Promoting prescribers and antibiotic stewardship team leaders to collaborate and conduct proactive audit and feedback.
Antibiotics are given to many hospital inpatients [35,36].
Antibiotic resistance threatens the health and safety of patients in all healthcare settings in Europe [1].
The incidence of Clostridium difficile infections decreased in the medical and surgical wards of an acute general hospital in the United Kingdom in response to revised empirical antibiotic treatment guidelines for common infections and restrictive measures for fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin usage [48].
Each year across Europe, EAAD is marked by national campaigns on the prudent use of antibiotics on or around 18 November.
Being alone at that time was a terrible blow, I felt very low and extremely isolated.

If you wish to support the campaign, share messages, pictures or videos during the week 18-24 November 2019, using the hashtag #KeepAntibioticsWorking .
When possible, prevent infection through appropriate vaccination.
Whenever antibiotic-resistant bacteria emerge and develop, infection control precautions are essential to prevent spread from carriers of infected patients to other patients or persons.
Only 70 years after the introduction of antibiotics, we are facing the possibility of a future without effective drugs to treat bacterial infections.
When they are no longer effective, it is extremely difficult or, in many cases, impossible to treat these infections.
Ensure that identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing results are communicated to prescribers, nurses and the antibiotic stewardship team especially for critical results (e.g. blood cultures) [98-100].
The risk in hospitals is that E. coli from your own gut could be introduced in blood or other tissue when performing invasive procedures such as surgery or injection.
Regularly participate in training courses and in meetings that support the implementation in the hospital of: a) prudent antibiotic use, b) evidence-based, local antibiotic guidelines, and c) infection prevention and control measures [52,53].
When antibiotics are needed (this decision is made by a medical doctor who writes a prescription), they should then be used appropriately, i.e. at the correct dose, at correct intervals and for the prescribed duration, to optimise effectiveness to cure the infection and minimise emergence of resistance;
There are more than 15 different classes of antibiotics that differ in their chemical structure and their action against bacteria.
A proportion of antimicrobial prescriptions for medical prophylaxis may therefore represent unnecessary use.
• Long-term surveillance of the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (e.g. in intensive care units, or for specific infection types).
CA-MRSA infections are mainly skin infections (boils), abscesses; sometimes more severe infections may occur (e.g. bloodstream infections), above all if CA-MRSA produces a toxin, such as Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PLV).
Does the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals contribute to the problem?
This should include the indication, drug choice, dose, route of administration and duration of treatment.
b) Collaborating with the hospital pharmacist and the clinical microbiologist to implement the antibiotic stewardship programme;
Because resistance is increasing and few new antibiotics have been discovered and marketed in recent years, the problem of antibiotic resistance is now a major public health threat.
I had a badly broken leg and was rushed to hospital lying on the floor of an ambulance.
Treating infections due to resistant bacteria is a challenge: antibiotics commonly used are no longer effective and doctors have to choose other antibiotics.
Availability of guidelines, consultation with infectious diseases specialist, and trainings represent the most helpful interventions to promote better use of antibiotics [25,27].

d) Facilitating communication between physicians, the pharmacy, the laboratory, discharge planners, consultants and patients;
Regularly train hospital prescribers on prudent antibiotic use and participate in meetings on implementing evidence-based hospital antibiotic guidelines [31,53].
Most prophylaxis courses may therefore represent unnecessary use of antimicrobials.
Hungary - Infectious disease specialist consultation in a surgical intensive care unit, together with a restricted prescribing policy, led to lower use of all antibiotics and a marked reduction in use of broad-spectrum antibiotics [61].
b) More adverse events, because alternative antibiotic therapies, that are more toxic, must often be used;
While on holiday, Paolo developed a complicated urinary tract infection with an E. coli isolate that produced extended-spectrum-beta lactamases (ESBL).
This resistance may be transferred to other bacteria [41].
a) Participating in the antibiotic stewardship team, as a key member of the team;
Use them wisely - and never against colds and flu
After a while, however, he developed a fever with shaking chills and the symptoms of his urinary tract infection intensified.
Many prescribers do not know antibiotic resistance prevalence rates in their local setting [25,26], and recognise lacks in their training regarding antibiotic use [27].
• 58% reported reductions in antibiotic resistance.
Antibiotic resistance is the ability of bacteria to resist the action of an antibiotic.
Learn and apply all antibiotic use and infection prevention and control recommendations that are relevant to your area of specialisation [expert consensus].
Paolo was on the island of Ponza where there was no possibility of laboratory testing of his urine to better understand which antibiotics the bug could be treated with.
Paolo's E. coli was found to be sensitive only to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fosfomycin and to the carbapenems, a class of last-line antibiotics, which are the treatment of choice for bacteria that produce ESBLs.
The proportion of broad-spectrum antibiotics varied from 16% to 62% across Europe.
- Patients are up to three times more likely to die if their infections is caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, compared with carbapenem-susceptible isolates [14].
Provide feedback and advice to prescribers on antibiotic choice, dose, duration optimisation and route of administration [31,94].

It was a horrible experience but it hasn't stopped me wanting to travel; I am already planning my next trip to Kerala.
Because resistance is increasing and few new antibiotics have been discovered and marketed in recent years, antibiotic resistance is now a major public health threat.
Provide data on antibiotic resistance at hospital level and ward level, and communicate trends to the antibiotic stewardship team and the infection prevention and control team [101].
Promote local guidelines on managing infections and using antibiotics.
When you use antibiotics incorrectly: if you shorten the duration of treatment, lower the doses, don't comply with the right frequency (taking the drug once a day instead of 2 or 3 times a day as directed), you won't have enough drug in your body and the bacteria will survive and may become resistant.

As hospital prescribers your tasks related to improving antibiotic use include [31,42,43,52-54,56,70,71,90]:
a) Administering antibiotics to patients according to the prescription;
The term "Healthcare-associated infections" is now preferred because it includes not only infections acquired in hospitals, but also in other settings where healthcare is provided, e.g. long-term care facilities, nursing homes, home care, etc.
The latest data confirms that across the European Union the number of patients infected by resistant bacteria is increasing and that antibiotic resistance is a major threat to public health.
d) Never share leftover antibiotics with other residents or other people.
These resistant bacteria may spread and cause infections in other people who have not taken any antibiotics.
Remain aware of local antibiotic resistance patterns in your department, your hospital and in the community [31,72].
Permission to use the European Antibiotic Awareness Day campaign communication materials is granted to all non-profit organizations and healthcare associations as well as all European healthcare authorities and governmental bodies conducting campaigns aimed at reducing antibiotic resistance and promoting the appropriate use of antibiotics.
Infections with third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli are responsible for the highest burden and more than half of these infections occur in the community.
Key messages for hospital managers / administrators
This is the only exception where systemic antibiotics can be dispensed without a prescription.
Follow infection prevention and control measures that are already established in your setting.
Although this type of resistance is rare in Scandinavia, many other cases seen in Europe have been linked to hospitalisation abroad.
Eventually, I was moved to a private room and had a hip replacement operation.
The major cause of antimicrobial resistance remains the use of antimicrobials in human medicine.

Treatment of antibiotic-resistant bacteria may also require intravenous antibiotics given in hospitals instead of oral antibiotics that could be taken by patients at home.
76% of hospitals reported the availability of antimicrobial use guidelines.
a) Take antibiotics exactly as prescribed;
It may also be transmitted from another person via direct contact (hands).
Clinicians are responsible for prescribing and they must be fully engaged in shared decision-making with the antibiotic stewardship team [42].
Persuasive measures include proactive audit and feedback by infectious diseases physicians, microbiologists and pharmacists.
a) Coordinating hospital surveillance and prevention and control programmes of healthcare-associated infections;
When it is resistant to methicillin (or to oxacillin, a type of penicillin), it is called MRSA or "Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus".
In August of 2010, Paolo had gone motor-boating alone to Ponza, a small island off the coast of Italy.
Bacterial diseases would spread and could no longer be treated, causing death.
Before you prescribe an antibiotic, you should [25,26,53,70] [expert consensus]:
ECDC is happy to double check modifications.
• Long durations of antibiotics are used;
Prescribing the shortest evidence-based duration of antibiotic treatment reduces emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria [54,56,71,91].
b) Ensuring infection prevention and control guidelines, protocols and checklists are available for preventing both healthcare-associated infections and transmission of microorganisms
Narrowing or streamlining antibiotic therapy leads to better patient outcomes [106].
Previous antibiotic treatment, e.g. with fluoroquinolones, has been associated with higher risks of resistance in E. coli.
Conversely, many healthcare-associated infections are caused by microorganisms that are not resistant to antimicrobials.
Nosocomial infections correspond to infections acquired in hospitals.
Up to half of all antibiotic use in hospitals is unnecessary of inappropriate.

Italy - A four-year infection control programme decreased the incidence of infections and colonisation caused by carbapenem-resistant bacteria in a teaching hospital.
Additionally, he was allergic to one of them, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
Why hospitals should be promoting antibiotic stewardship?
40% of all Europeans wrongly believe that antibiotics work against colds and flu, show the data from the 2013 Eurobarometer on antibiotic consumption and knowledge.
Additionally, within the body of a human being, the genes coding for antibiotic resistance in one species of bacteria can easily spread to other bacterial species through an exchange of genetic material.

The programme included antibiotic stewardship measures targeting carbapenem use [62].
The mandate of ECDC is to identify and assess the risks of communicable diseases for EU citizens and communicate about these risks; this includes the area of antimicrobial resistance.
Examples of such bacteria are carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacteriaceae (often Klebsiella pneumoniae), andmultidrug-resistant Acinetobacter.

Staphylococcus aureus is a common bacterium, present on skin and mucosa in 20% to 30% of healthy people.
Template letters to pharmacists and primary care prescribers
It is important to stress that the template materials developed by ECDC provide core information and common messages, but will be most effective if adapted to respond to the needs and situations in each country, and even each hospital or healthcare setting.
Ensure that cultures are taken before starting antibiotics [31,42,70,71].
iv. enhance prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections and the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
The key messages are based on the results of the point prevalence surveys.

Both restrictive measures and persuasive measures can decrease antibiotic use [19,43,54,56]:
The bacterium was susceptible only to one antibiotic, colistin.
He was also found to have an enlarged prostate gland, which was the likely cause of his infection.
• 71% reported reduced healthcare-associated infections;
He was prescribed amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, which he took by mouth for four weeks.
Antibiotics used to treat and prevent infections in animals belong to the same chemical groups as those used in human medicine, therefore animals may carry bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics also used to treat infections in humans;

Furthermore, the infographic shows the percentages of resistance against the most common groups of antibiotics.
d) Preventing and reducing antibiotic resistance, together with infection prevention and control measures.
Escherichia coli or E. coli is one of the most common bacteria in the digestive tract (gut) of each of us.
It is an adaptation of the microorganism to its environment.
Regularly participate in training courses and in meetings that support the implementation in the hospital of: a) prudent antibiotic use, b) evidence-based, local antibiotic guidelines, and c) infection prevention and control measures [52,53].
Healthcare professionals play a fundamental role in tackling antibiotic resistance.
Microorganisms - also called microbes - include bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites.
Promote compliance with evidence-based guidelines for diagnosing and managing common infections, and for perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis.
It is therefore necessary to see a doctor and to have microbiological testing performed.
Explain to patients how to relieve symptoms of colds and flu without antibiotics.
This guidance can include guidelines, protocols and checklists [expert consensus].
The infographic explains what antibiotic resistance is and highlights the extent of the problems that we are facing due to antibiotic resistance and antibiotic consumption in humans - in hospitals and in the community.
Antibiotic resistance and food-producing animals

b) Appointing leaders that are responsible for the overall programme and for antibiotic use.
i) liaising with public health organisations,
Ciprofloxacin can be given by mouth, so is easy to take and is usually effective in treating urinary tract infections.
It typically causes skin and wound infections but can cause pulmonary, surgical site, bloodstream, heart, bone and other invasive infections.
Without #antibiotics, we won't be able to treat simple infections.
The poster contains a key message that is deemed relevant overall for the hospital or the healthcare setting, followed by a set of actions that the hospital prescriber can/should/must implement to ensure that antibiotics remain effective.
Without effective antibiotics, intensive care, organ transplants, cancer chemotherapy, care of preterm babies, or even common surgical procedures, such as hip or knee replacement, would not be possible.
Before the discovery of antibiotics, thousands of people died from bacterial diseases, such as pneumonia or infection following surgery.
Avoid unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis (e.g. urinary tract infection prophylaxis) [111].
Compliance with formulary restrictions as well as pre-approval and post-authorisation requirements for specific antibiotics decreases the use of these antibiotics in intensive care unit settings [43].
I was given a bowl of water once a day, but having a broken leg meant I couldn't move to wash myself or change my clothes, so I just lay there in the heat.
Follow your doctor's advice when taking antibiotics.
Since October 2008, it is possible for patients in the UK who are asymptomatic but who have a diagnosed genital infection with Chlamydia to obtain from pharmacists (without a prescription) a single dose of the antibiotic azithromycin, representing a complete treatment course.
The carbapenems, to which his E.coli was sensitive, are the antibiotics of choice in patients with infections with ESBL-producing bacteria.
d) Reduced quality of patient stay due to anxiety because of the need for rigorous infection control measures;
Sweden - Twice weekly audit and feedback in an internal medicine department led to an absolute 27% reduction of antibiotic use , especially of broad-spectrum antibiotics (cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones), as well as shorter antibiotic treatment durations and earlier switching to oral therapy [68].
Always perform a clinical examination of the patient before prescribing an antibiotic [31].
Always use antibiotics under medical prescription, not using "leftovers" or antibiotics obtained without a prescription.
These should be readily and reliably accessible to all healthcare providers [56,69].
The toolkit contains template materials and key messages for health professionals, ideas for awareness raising activities, and suggested tactics for getting the messages across to both primary care providers and patients.
If these guidelines do not exist in your hospital, then support their development [31,54,56].
Despite these encouraging experiences, antimicrobial resistance still is high or increasing in a majority of Member States, in particular for common bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
A patient leaflet for primary care prescribers to hand out to patients: it explains to patients what antibiotic resistance is and why appropriate use of antibiotics is important.
Each year, 33000 people die as a direct consequence of an infection due to bacteria resistant to antibiotics.

Such multidrug-resistant bacteria are a real and constant threat to clinical practice in all healthcare settings in Europe [1].
On arrival at the mainland, he immediately went to a large hospital in Rome where he had a urine culture and clinical examination, which confirmed he had a complicated urinary tract infection.
Communicating to professionals in hospitals and long-term care facilities
In the countries with the highest consumption, people consume 3.4 times more antibiotics than in the countries with the lowest consumption.
What is the most important cause of antibiotic resistance?
75% of the burden of bacteria resistant to antibiotics in Europe is due to healthcare-associated infections.
The sum of these DALYs across the population, or the burden of disease, can be thought of as a measurement of the gap between current health status and an ideal health situation where the entire population lives to an advanced age, free of disease and disability.
e) Higher direct and indirect hospital costs.
Take a thorough patient history when you prescribe an antibiotic, including recent antibiotic use, drug allergies, use of immunosuppressive therapy, and risk factors for antibiotic resistance (for example, recent hospitalisation, recent procedure or recent travel outside of Europe) [31].
Travellers that require hospital care while visiting a country with high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, within or outside of the EU, and who are subsequently repatriated to their home country, may return being colonised or even infected by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
The toolkit contains template materials and some suggested key messages focusing on self-medication with antibiotics, ideas for awareness raising activities, and suggested tactics for getting the messages across to the general public regarding prudent use of antibiotics, especially to people self-medicating with antibiotics.

For antibiotic stewardship teams to be successful, they need the active support of other key professionals in hospitals, such as infection prevention and control professionals, emergency department practitioners, hospital epidemiologists, nurses and IT staff [42,77].
Antibiotics are misused when they are prescribed unnecessarily (i.e. antibiotic treatment is not clinically needed) or when they are prescribed inappropriately, i.e. one of the following [18]:
Moreover, only 1 in 5 LTFCs have regular training on appropriate antimicrobial prescribing.
Consult the antibiotic stewardship team when needed, for examples when you prescribe an antibiotic outside of normal guidelines [31,56] [expert consensus].
When exposed to antibiotics, susceptible bacteria are killed and resistant bacteria can continue to grow and multiply.
Antibiotics have long-term effects on the development and persistence of antibiotic resistance in the microbiota.
Your tasks related to improving antibiotic use include [42,56,76,94,95]:
Before the discovery of antibiotics, thousands of people died from bacterial diseases, such as pneumonia or infection following surgery.
There are also large variations in antibiotic use among EU Member States, as shown by data from the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption (ESAC) project;
ECDC also partners with numerous professional and patient organisations, the European Commission, the European Food Safety Authority, the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe, as well international campaigns in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Japan, to undertake a number of actions to address antimicrobial resistance.

Antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, including multidrug-resistant types, are often responsible for healthcare-associated infections, but they are also responsible for infections in patients outside hospitals and can be found as part of the normal bacterial flora of healthy individuals, in pet animals and in the environment.
The ECDC directory (link) contains online resources for developing guidelines.
This issue of multidrug resistance is relevant for all microorganisms, including bacteria responsible for healthcare-associated infections, microorganisms responsible for food- and waterborne infections, tuberculosis, and microorganisms responsible for sexually-transmitted diseases, e.g. gonorrhoea and HIV.
A more worrying problem is when some bacteria that are normally susceptible to antibiotics become resistant as a result of adaptation through genetic change (acquired resistance).
Provide funds and resources for an antibiotic stewardship programme (including e.g., salaries for dedicated staff, IT capabilities, rapid and point-of-care diagnostic tests) [31].
However, excessive and inappropriate use of antibiotics accelerates the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
f) Re-evaluating treatment after 48-72 hours, or when results from microbiological samples are available;
g) Initiating antibiotic treatment as soon as possible in patients with severe infection;
Back in Norway, I had to go straight back into hospital.
Without antibiotics, we could return to the "pre-antibiotic era", when organ transplants, cancer chemotherapy, intensive care and other medical procedures would no longer be possible.
There were times when I was not sure if I would survive.
1 in 3 patients received at least one antimicrobial on any given day.
Inform the prescriber or pharmacist if you see a patient has an antibiotic prescription which has continued beyond seven days without specified duration [69].
Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria may require more care as well as alternative and more expensive antibiotics, which also may have more severe side effects.
Remain aware of local antibiotic resistance patterns in the community, hospital and department [31] [expert consensus].
Use local data on healthcare-associated infections, set local targets and find areas where additional infection prevention and control support is needed [82,85] [expert consensus].
Since 2015, the World Health Organization leads the World Antibiotic Awareness Week , a global campaign taking place on the week of the 18 November.
Additionally, cases of infections due to bacteria totally or almost totally resistant to antibiotics are currently emerging in the EU.
b) Have the appropriate cultures been taken before starting antibiotic therapy?
