I was also worried that the wound from my surgery would become infected as it still had not healed.
3 out of 4 of the prophylaxis courses were given to prevent urinary tract infections.
Participate regularly in training courses and meetings on prudent antibiotic use, specimen collection, and infection prevention and control [53,96].
Molecular analysis showed that the isolate contained a gene responsible for producing the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1), a novel carbapenemase.
Patients, doctors, nurses: it is everyone's responsibility to use antibiotics prudently.
However, excessive and inappropriate use of antibiotics accelerates the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

Could an antibiotic with a narrower spectrum be used to treat the infection?
c) Consulting with hospital prescribers and providing them with feedback to ensure the quality of antibiotic prescribing;
For example:

Monitor how effective targeted preventive measures are at reducing transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria [82,85] [expert consensus].
An antibiotic may be effective against only one or multiple types of bacteria.
The toolkit contains template materials and key messages for health professionals, ideas for awareness raising activities, and suggested tactics for getting the messages across to both primary care providers and patients.
b) Never save antibiotics for later use;
Ensure that patients (and their families) understand the reasons for antibiotic therapy, and key points related to antibiotic use, including to [expert consensus]:
As hospital prescribers your tasks related to improving antibiotic use include [31,42,43,52-54,56,70,71,90]:
Antibiotics have long-term effects on the development and persistence of antibiotic resistance in the microbiota.
Does the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals contribute to the problem?
What is the problem?
h) Guiding empirical antibiotic therapy by providing hospital and ward specific (e.g. intensive care unit or emergency department) cumulative antimicrobial susceptibility data;
Your tasks related to improving antibiotic use include [31,96,97] [expert consensus]:
Answer the following key questions to optimise antibiotic therapy.
Core tasks to improve antibiotic use in your facility include:
c) Supporting evidence-based hospital antibiotic guidelines for common infections and for surgical prophylaxis;
In a few countries, decreasing trends are being observed for antibiotic use in outpatients and for antibiotic resistance in bacteria commonly responsible for infections in outpatients.
Ensure that identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing results are communicated to prescribers, nurses and the antibiotic stewardship team especially for critical results (e.g. blood cultures) [98-100].
Antimicrobial resistance, i.e. being resistant to one or several antimicrobials used for therapy or prophylaxis, is not a disease but a characteristic that may apply, as a matter of principle, to each of the microorganisms responsible for the communicable diseases listed in Commission Decision 2000/96/EC and for nosocomial and other healthcare-associated infections.
Poster for intensive care unit physicians: Things to do to keep antibiotics working.
Misuse of antibiotics accelerates the emergence and dissemination of antibiotic resistance [8,31-34].
Take a thorough patient history when you prescribe an antibiotic, including recent antibiotic use, drug allergies, use of immunosuppressive therapy, and risk factors for antibiotic resistance (for example, recent hospitalisation, recent procedure or recent travel outside of Europe) [31].
Provide data on antibiotic resistance at hospital level and ward level, and communicate trends to the antibiotic stewardship team and the infection prevention and control team [101].
programmes for infection prevention and control;
Even without having been in contact with healthcare, people who travel in a country with high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance may return being colonised by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
Your task is to ensure that the fundamental elements of the hospital infection prevention and control programme are carried out [82,84,85] [expert consensus].
When antibiotics are needed (this decision is made by a medical doctor who writes a prescription), they should then be used appropriately, i.e. at the correct dose, at correct intervals and for the prescribed duration, to optimise effectiveness to cure the infection and minimise emergence of resistance;
a) Establishing a multidisciplinary team for your hospital antibiotic stewardship programme.
b) Collaborating with the infectious disease specialist and the hospital pharmacist to implement the antibiotic stewardship programme;
h) Managing your hospital's antimicrobial formulary (i.e., list of drugs available for prescribers).
Microorganisms - also called microbes - include bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites.
Antimicrobials are medicinal products that kill or stop the growth of living microorganisms and include among others:
It is not always possible to determine the proportion of resistant infections caused by a single factor.
b) The spectrum of antibiotic therapy is either too narrow or too broad;
b) Collaborating with the hospital pharmacist and the clinical microbiologist to implement the antibiotic stewardship programme;
Antivirals (active against viral infections, e.g. influenza, HIV, herpes infections),
The emergence of bacteria resistant to multiple classes of antibiotics is particularly concerning.
Ensure that cultures are taken before starting antibiotics [31,42,70,71].
Since 2008, ECDC coordinates the European Antibiotic Awareness Day, a public health initiative which aims to provide a platform and support for national campaigns on the prudent use of antibiotics.
Aim at creating a sense of individual responsibility in tackling antibiotic resistance and at empowering professionals to take action.

Antibiotic resistance - an increasing threat to human health
Even when antibiotics are used appropriately, antibiotic resistance sometimes develops as a natural adaptive reaction of bacteria.
While in India, Lill-Karin underwent orthopaedic surgery and prophylactic antibiotic treatment with linezolid.
I was given a bowl of water once a day, but having a broken leg meant I couldn't move to wash myself or change my clothes, so I just lay there in the heat.
Not all antibiotics are active against all bacteria.
Such multidrug-resistant bacteria are a real and constant threat to clinical practice in all healthcare settings in Europe [1].
This leaves only a few, or no antibiotics available for treatment.
There is no rational choice of antibiotic therapy for treating such patients and treatment often relies on old and toxic antibiotics such as colistin.
Key messages are the cornerstone of any communication campaign.
EAAD partners with World Antibiotic Awareness Week
A factsheet on antibiotic resistance in primary care provides primary care prescribers with EU and national data on the latest trends.

Patients colonised by/carrying resistant bacteria are generally more likely to develop an infection with these resistant bacteria rather than with susceptible variants of the same bacteria;
Communication toolkit to promote prudent antibiotic use with focus on self-medication with antibiotics
Activities related to this topic at ECDC take place under the Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare-associated Infections programme .
What are the risks of MRSA in hospitals?
â€¢ 65% reported reduced length of stay or mortality;
Infographics explaining the process of antibiotic resistance, the relation between antibiotic consumption and antimicrobial resistance, the recent trend of growing resistance to last-line antibiotics.
It is everyone's responsibility to use antibiotics prudently.
They are asking for local antibiotic guidelines, specific education and antibiotic stewardship teams [25,27].
Countries could consider leveraging the national antibiotic resistance and antibiotic consumption data available from EARS-Net and ESAC-Net respectively, and consulting with national professional associations on the most appropriate tools to be used in their country.
c) Have you checked for recent antibiotic use, drug allergies, use of immunosuppressive therapy, recent hospitalisation or institutionalisation, recent travel outside of Europe, and microbiology results for the previous 3 months?
Both restrictive measures and persuasive measures can decrease antibiotic use [19,43,54,56]:
Nobody knows where he picked up the infection.
Netherlands - Case audits for the reassessment of antibiotic use after 48 hours reduced antibiotic consumption and length of stay in a urology ward of an academic hospital, and also had a positive direct return on investment [64,65].
e) Auditing and reporting healthcare-associated infections surveillance data;
Preliminary estimates of the number of deaths directly attributable to hospital-acquired infections due to the most common major multidrug-resistant bacteria are 1/3 to 1/2 of that for hospital-acquired infections overall (see below) (ECDC, preliminary data).
The number of deaths attributable to infections with third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli increased four-fold.
Key messages for clinical microbiologists
Getting an effective treatment for urinary tract infection due to resistant E. coli may be delayed, possibly resulting in serious complications such as kidney or bloodstream infection.
Provide feedback and advice to prescribers on diagnostic evaluation and treatment of infectious diseases [83].
The burden of infections with bacteria resistant to antibiotics on the European population is comparable to that of influenza, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS combined.
In recent years, an increase in infections due to E. coli resistant to many antibiotics at the same time, including fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins, has been reported.
