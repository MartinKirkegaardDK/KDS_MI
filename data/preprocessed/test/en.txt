Antimicrobial resistance results in a reduction or elimination of effectiveness of the antimicrobial agent to cure or prevent infection due to this microorganism.
c) Never use leftover antibiotics from previous treatments; and
You are in an important position to improve antibiotic prescribing in both inpatients and outpatients, since your facility sits at the interface of the hospital and the community [77].
c) Improving the quality of antibiotic prescribing (e.g. checking for drug interactions, optimising dosage and route of administration, preventing adverse events);
After arriving at the hospital, I spent two days on a plastic bed in a large room, surrounded by sick people.

- Patients with bloodstream infections have a threefold higher mortality rate, prolonged hospital stays, and higher costs if their infection is due to third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli, compared with third-generation cephalosporin-susceptible isolates [12].
Getting an effective treatment for urinary tract infection due to resistant E. coli may be delayed, possibly resulting in serious complications such as kidney or bloodstream infection.
Core tasks to improve the use of antibiotics in your department include:
1/6 of Europeans are not aware that the misuse of antibiotics makes them less effective (with subtitles)
His brother-in-law suggested that he take ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic which is one of the most frequently used antibiotics for urinary tract infections.
Antimicrobial resistance, i.e. being resistant to one or several antimicrobials used for therapy or prophylaxis, is not a disease but a characteristic that may apply, as a matter of principle, to each of the microorganisms responsible for the communicable diseases listed in Commission Decision 2000/96/EC and for nosocomial and other healthcare-associated infections.
Tell the world what you do, in your professional or personal life, at individual or collective level, to use antibiotics responsibly and keep them working!
In France and Belgium, the decrease was attributed to national action including a yearly, nationwide public campaign on the prudent use of antibiotics;
Some of the messages are indicated to be "expert consensus", instead of being linked to a reference taken from the scientific literature.
Everyone can play an important role in decreasing antibiotic resistance:
You can watch and participate in the discussion; the event will be live-streamed on our Facebook page.
Ask your pharmacist about how to dispose of the remaining medicines
Remain aware of local antibiotic resistance patterns in your department, your hospital and in the community [31] [expert consensus].
Inadequate antimicrobial treatment of infections: a risk factor for hospital mortality among critically ill patients.
Broad-spectrum antibiotics are not always necessary and their use drives antimicrobial resistance.
d) Consulting with hospital prescribers and providing them with feedback to ensure the quality of antibiotic prescribing;
Seek guidance and advice from a senior colleague or a member of the antibiotic stewardship team.
b) Coordinating the taking and sending of microbiological specimens, and their reporting back to physicians;
HAIs in hospitals (for example, pneumonia, surgical site infections and bloodstream infections) are usually more severe and have a higher impact than HAIs in long-term care facilities (for example, respiratory infections other than pneumonia, urinary tract infections and skin and soft tissue infections).
Answer the following key questions to optimise antibiotic therapy.
ECDC would be interested to know how and where the campaign communication materials are used, particularly if you think that your initiatives could be listed on the â€˜National activities' page of this website.
What are the risks of MRSA in the community?
Not all antibiotics are active against all bacteria.
What is the resistance situation in other regions in the world?
Since antibiotics have been discovered and used, more and more bacteria, which were originally susceptible, have become resistant and developed numerous different means of fighting against antibiotics.
f) Ensuring that antibiotics listed in hospital formulary are always available; and
Organising regular multidisciplinary staff rounds and case discussions to improve the quality of antibiotic treatment [72].
Strengthen surveillance activities for antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance [56].
Help advertise the European Antibiotic Awareness Day in newsletters, websites, in the media and on the Internet, by inserting a link on your website, in your e-mail signature or in your blog.
An antibiotic may be effective against only one or multiple types of bacteria.

I was also worried that the wound from my surgery would become infected as it still had not healed.
ECDC also launched, and regularly updates, a directory of online resources for the prevention and control of antimicrobial resistance and healthcare-associated infections to support EU Member States that need to develop national guidelines.
Stories of people whose lives were dramatically changed by antibiotic-resistant superbugs
A more worrying problem is when some bacteria, that are normally susceptible to antibiotics, become resistant as a result of genetic changes (acquired resistance).
The emergence of bacteria resistant to multiple classes of antibiotics is particularly concerning.
Thankfully, I am now fully recovered and free of the infection, but for a time I was very afraid of catching a cold or something worse.
Antimicrobial stewardship targeting primary care prescribers as well as infection prevention and control interventions in primary care are therefore necessary to reduce the burden of these infections.
Data from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) show that there is a gradient North-South with low rates in Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands and high rates in Southern Europe.
e) Training and education for medical, pharmacy, laboratory, nursing, and non-clinical staff, as well as patients and their families;
Between 2007 and 2015, the burden of each of the 16 antibiotic-resistant bacteria under study has increased:
Ensure that cultures are appropriately taken and send to the microbiology laboratory, before starting antibiotics [31,42,70].
j) embedding infection prevention and control in all policies, and
His condition did not improve over the next three days and his fever did not abate.
Escherichia coli resistance to major antibiotics is increasing in almost all countries in Europe.
Once established in a person, antibiotic-resistant bacteria can spread to another person and a high antibiotic consumption in a population (hospital or community) strongly favours such spread.
Again this year, on the occasion of EAAD, we are asking doctors, nurses, hospital managers, pharmacists, farmers, veterinarians, policymakers, professional and patient organisations, governmental institutions, and the general public to share a message.
Increasingly, many European countries have national guidance on antimicrobial stewardship programmes for hospital prescribers.
Improving antibiotic use in the emergency department can lead to better antibiotic use across the entire organisation, because the emergency department is a common point of entry to the inpatient setting [77].
While in India, Lill-Karin underwent orthopaedic surgery and prophylactic antibiotic treatment with linezolid.
a) Is there a high probability of a bacterial infection, rather than colonisation or a viral infection?
Wash your hands and your children's hands regularly, for instance after sneezing or coughing before touching other things or people.
e) Auditing and reporting healthcare-associated infections surveillance data;
This is a worrisome trend because these bacteria can spread easily in healthcare settings if adequate infection prevention and control measures are not in place.
b) Deciding on the first antibiotic dose for inpatients;
Aim at creating a sense of individual responsibility in tackling antibiotic resistance and at empowering professionals to take action.
Ensure that patients (and their families) understand the reasons for antibiotic therapy, and key points related to antibiotic use, including to [expert consensus]:
c) Never use leftover antibiotics from previous treatments;
f) Sharing information on local microbiology and antibiotic resistance patterns; and,
f) Monitoring patient status on a 24 hour basis; and
I didn't feel any symptoms of the infection, but it was a very difficult time.

c) Hospital-based teams, which include infectious disease specialists, clinical pharmacists and microbiologists, providing support to prescribers;
The European Antibiotic Awareness Day is an annual European public health initiative that takes place on 18 November to raise awareness about the threat to public health of antibiotic resistance and the importance of prudent antibiotic use.
k) ensuring, from the board level to the ward, that all staff understand their role in preventing infections.
Infections with multidrug-resistant bacteria can be severe, fatal and costly and can directly lead to [2-11] [expert consensus]:
In a recent survey of hospitals that had implemented an antibiotic stewardship programme [47]:
Always follow your doctor's advice on when and how to use antibiotics.
Antibiotic resistance is a natural occurrence caused by mutations in bacteria's genes.
The bacterium that was isolated from Mohammed's bloodstream was resistant to many antibiotics, including the last-source antibiotics - a class of last-line antibiotics called carbapenems.
Infographic about antibiotic stewardship programmes
Correct timing and optimal duration of antibiotic prophylaxis for surgery leads to fewer surgical site infections, and decreases the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria [73].
If you see staff members at the hospital or healthcare setting who breach guidelines or protocols, ask them why they are doing so and provide them with tools to understand what they are doing wrong [69] [expert consensus].
i) Identifying critical trends in antibiotic resistance in the hospital and promptly communicating observations to the antibiotic stewardship team and the infection control team.
The primary target audience for this toolkit is professionals in hospitals and other healthcare settings, such as long-term care facilities, who have different roles and influence in the use of antibiotics in such settings.
j) Managing your hospital's antimicrobial formulary (i.e., list of drugs available for prescribers).
Countries could consider leveraging the national antibiotic resistance and antibiotic consumption data available from EARS-Net and ESAC-Net respectively, and consulting with national professional associations on the most appropriate tools to be used in their country.
A pharmacist-led parenteral-to-oral switch resulted in shortened parenteral therapy durations without negatively impacting on clinical outcomes [56].
