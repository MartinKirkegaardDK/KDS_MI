- preprocessing
	- filter small sentences
	- test/train/eval?
- steering vector (with other method)
- driver functions to run utilities (experiments)
- run experiments and save results
- from meeting:
	- other method for where to insert probes
		- maybe perplexity (loss on parallel data under steering)
	- evaluation of text after steering
		- language id model to see which language text is (this would also check if output is coherent?)
